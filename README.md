Link to deployed website:

Our project is called "Spoon-Fed Reviews" which is a website dedicated to sharing and reviewing websites created by users. As a user, you are able to create a login and profile, where you can then write and upload recipes. Your recipes are stored in your profile and can be viewed by other users. Other users may comment on to "review" your recipe, as well as up-vote or down-vote the recipe. The user has access to a compiled list of their recipes, as well as a list of their past reviews on other's recipes. The user may also search recipes based on ingredients or category to find a well-reviewed recipe they want to try.

Our team learned a lot, and got comfortable building the models, using sequelize, building our routes for the get, post, put and delete requests, and building a smooth UI.
